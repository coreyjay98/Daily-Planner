# Daily Planner

Here I have created a simple daily planner that can be used regularly to save reminders and messages for the user which will still be available upon revisiting the site. This planner also has css indicators that show the user which timed events have passed and which are in the future, this is useful as it is a quite and simple indicator to improve the UI experience for the user

## Project review

This project was initially a challenge for me as I had to use my limited knowledge of Jquery and Javascript and then introduce new libraries such as moment.js and use them in collaboration with each other to build this planner. This meant that I had to work hard to ensure I was using these right and thoroughly research the documentations to code these libraries into my work. I managed to use them correctly and build a fully functioning planner and so I have taken another step in mastering Javascript!
